* vim-like bindings (see PyanoH3ro)
* tracker but with note push and note hold functionality
    * step: "smallest" resolution of a note -- you can push early but can't add more notes than steps
    * pitch(i8): measured from A4
    * delta-pitch(desired, steps)
        * desired: i8, desired pitch
        * steps: u8, number of steps before we get from the current to the desired pitch
    * note(push, fine-hold, hold, length)
        * push: i8, negative starts the note early, positive means start it late
            * +-120 is a full step ahead/behind
        * fine-hold: i8, negative makes it staccato, positive makes it longer
            * +-120 is a full step added/removed
        * hold: u8, in steps.
            * amount of time to hold the note
        * length: u8, in steps = hold + wait
            * amount of time before we play the next note
        * [derived] wait: u8, in steps = length - hold
            * amount of time to wait after holding the note before we play the next
    * volume(u8)
    * delta-volume(desired, steps)
        * desired: u8, desired volume
        * steps: u8, number of steps before we get from the current to the desired volume
